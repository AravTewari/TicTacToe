# TicTacToe
The TicTacToe project from Hyperskill.org

The module asks to write code for a simple two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game. Original tasks required to read in a series of X's and O's and update them onto a gameboard in the form of a matrix, but it eventually started blank. In a game loop, the code asks for a coordinate and handles errors such as IndexOutOfBoundsException and if a coordinate is already filled. After that, it would check the game conditions, such as if there was a three-in-a-row or the gameboard was filled. The loop would restart, but this time it would be player two's turn.

*Main.java of the final task can be found in "task/src/tictactoe/Main.java"*
